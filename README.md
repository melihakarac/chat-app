# CHAT APP

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, install all the dependencies using your preferred package manager:

```bash
npm install
# or
yarn install
# or
pnpm install
# or
bun install
```

Next, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

## Environment Setup

Before starting the project, make sure to set up your `.env.local` file with the correct environment variables. There is a template available in `.env.example` that you can use to configure your local environment.

Copy the `.env.example` file to `.env.local` and fill in the appropriate values for each variable.

Make sure all necessary environment variables are correctly set before running the app.

## Deployment

Deployment is handled automatically based on branch commits:

- **Production Environment:** Committing to the `main` branch will trigger deployment to both [https://chat-app-mk.vercel.app/](https://chat-app-mk.vercel.app/).

Make sure to review changes thoroughly before committing to these branches, as deployments are immediate.
